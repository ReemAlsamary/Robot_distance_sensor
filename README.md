# Robot_distance_sensor
- The aim of this task is to design and program an electrical circuit to connect distance sensor with controller, with bluetooth module.

## Circuit components:
- Two Arduino Uno R3.
- One Breadboard.
- 6 Servo motors.
- One Ultrasonic distance sensor.

## Steps:
1. Connect the circuit's power and ground.
2. Connect the motor's signal pins to the Arduino's digital pins.
3. To the digtal arduino pins, connect the Ultrasonic TRIG and ECHO.
